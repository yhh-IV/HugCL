## 2. Render Test Results

Most raw data are readily visualizable using Office Excel's native tools.

Remaining raw data can be visualized by running the provided source code (.m), written in [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)>=R2023b.

## 3. Light DEMO Codes for Simulations

This DEMO shows the process of running simulation tests.
The function is to generate the interactive environment and decide the final trajectory.

### 3.1 Installation

The package is written in Python 3. The usage of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download) Python distribution is recommended.

After you have installed Python 3.8.1 or above, open a terminal in the Supplementary Software File and execute the following command to install the software (including the dependencies):

- Set Up Python Environment
    ```bash
    pip install -r ./requirements.txt
    ```

- Download [CARLA] (https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases)>=0.9.13

- Run CARLA in the downloaded CARLA folder

    ```bash
    .\CarlaUE4.exe
    ```

### 3.2 Usage

- Run the interactive environment:

    ```bash
    python .\HugCL\scenario_runner\scenario_runner.py
    ```

- Then, open another terminal and run the HugCL agent:

    ```bash
    python .\HugCL\inference.py
    ```

### 3.3 More Data for evaluation

You can collect more data for the evaluation. 

#### 3.3.1 CARLA-based Data Collection

- Run the interactive environment:

    ```bash
    python .\HugCL\scenario_runner\scenario_runner.py
    ```

- Then, open another terminal and run the HugCL agent:

    ```bash
    python .\HugCL\inference.py --data_collection
    ```

Continuous human trajectories collected from the steering wheel and pedals need to be parsed into discrete decisions.

-  Run the trajectory analysis:

     ```bash
     python .\traj_analysis\traj_analysis.py
     ```
We also provide a keyboard-based approach for directly collecting high-level decisions.

#### 3.3.2 Instruction for other data:

A single data point is formulated into {state, action, cumulative rewards, done}

State contains ego information, surrounding users information, traffic regulations and the destination.

After that, when given a state, the HugCL agent can generate an action according to the collected data.

    ./docker/build.sh --devel-only
    ```

- This install takes about 40 minutes.

We also provided a preâ€‘built version for docker image, which can be downloaded from Google Cloud.

- Build autoware workspace
     ```bash
    colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```

- This install takes about 30 minutes.

#### 4.2.5 Download field data records

- Download the field testing rosbag data from Google Cloud.
  
- Unzip the file and copy the rosbags to desired location.

    ```bash
    unzip HugCL_data.zip
    cd data
    cp -r rosbag/ PATH_TO_PROJECT/Supplementary_Software/Deployment/cl_inference/
    ```

### 4.3 Parse the high-definition map

We provide a miniminal  high-definition map and its parsing algorithm.

-  Run the map parser:

     ```bash
     python .\Deployment\HDmap\map_parser.py
     ```

### 4.4 Launch the field testing

- Run autoware in the downloaded AUTOWARE folder

    source .\install\setup.bash
    ```

- Trap termination signals to gracefully shutdown background processes
   
    ```bash
    trap 'echo "Stopping..."; kill $AUTOWARE_PID; exit' SIGINT SIGTERM
    ```

- Launch autoware in the background
   
    ```bash
    ros2 launch autoware_launch autoware.launch.xml \
    ```

- Open another terminal and run the HugCL agent inference script
    ```bash
    python3 inference_autoware_wrapper.py
